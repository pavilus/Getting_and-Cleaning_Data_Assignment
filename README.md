## Course Project
This document describes the code inside run_analysis.R.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. 

### Instructions
Just run the script in R or RStudio. It will download the database and make all the work.
 
### Project Summary

The run_analysis.R script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The final database is output as UCIDatabase.csv. 

### More Information
You can find additional information about the variables and data in the CodeBook.MD file.
